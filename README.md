Strongswan VPN

Introduction
• A virtual private network, or VPN, allows us to securely encrypt traffic as it travels through untrusted networks, such as those at the coffee shop, a conference, or an airport.
• IKEv2, or Internet Key Exchange v2, is a protocol that allows for direct IPSec tunneling between the server and client.
• In IKEv2 VPN implementations, IPSec provides encryption for the network traffic. IKEv2 is natively supported on some platforms (OS X 10.11+, iOS 9.1+, and Windows 10) with no additional applications necessary, and it handles client hiccups quite smoothly.
